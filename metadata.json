    "Description": "By combining a Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (MPGNN) and a Forward fully connected Neural Network (FNN) with an integrated gradients explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, the authors developed MolGrad and tested it on a number of ADME predictive tasks. MolGrad incorporates explainable features to facilitate interpretation of the predictions.In this model, they train MolGrad with a dataset of hERG channel blockers/non-blockers to predict the cardiotoxicity of small molecules (IC50 in hERG blockade).\n",
